# TokenBasedElection

This project will focus on creating token based election system utilizing previous work of https://github.com/clearmatics/mobius. 

Software will be build upon proof of concept application developed as a university project - https://github.com/Zymoo/S-Vote.

Initial code was created as a part of Dapp University coding tutorial (https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/code-your-own-cryptocurrency-on-ethereum) and upgraded to match more recent solidity standards.
